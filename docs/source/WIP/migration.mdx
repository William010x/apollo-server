title: Migrating to Apollo Server 4 (Alpha)
---

<!-- TODO: add getting started link -->
Apollo Server 4 is now out in [alpha](/docs/resources/release-stages). Check out our ["Getting Started" guide](/getting-started) to get up and running quickly.

> As the Apollo Server 4 rolls out we are in the process of bringing the rest of our documentation up to date. This migration guide covers all of the new changes between Apollo Server 3 and 4. Feel free to reference both the Apollo Server 3 docs in the meantime.

The focus of this major release is to improve Apollo Server's extensibility and make it simpler to use, maintain, and document. To learn more about the inspiration behind this release, see the [Apollo Server Roadmap](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)

Apollo Server 4's alpha provides two of following features, with more to come with the full release:
<!-- TODO: fill in -->
- A simple well-defined API with a stable HTTP abstraction, enabling contributors to easily build integrations in other frameworks.
- Consistent context typing for TS users, ensuring


<!-- Do we want this? -->
During Apollo Server 4's alpha we are actively looking to gather feedback and [issues](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/new/choose) from community members and customers.

## Bumped dependencies

### Node.js
Apollo Server 4 supports Node.js 14 and later. This includes all [LTS and Current versions at the time of release](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).

If you're using an older version of Node.js, upgrade your runtime before upgrading to Apollo Server 4.

### `graphql`

Apollo Server has a peer dependency on `graphql` (the core JS GraphQL implementation), which means you are responsible for choosing the version installed in your app.

Apollo Server 4 supports `graphql` v16.3.0 and later. (Apollo Server 3 supported `graphql` v15.3.0 through v16.)

If you're using an older version of `graphql`, upgrade it to a supported version before upgrading to Apollo Server 4.

## Removed integrations


### Body-parser & CORS wrapping
In Apollo Server 4, framework integration functions won't try to wrap these basic framework-specific libraries. If you want to use our Express middleware, you'll be required to use the standard body-parser middleware yourself.

```ts
```


Apollo Server 4's new `ApolloServerStandalone`(the replacement for the batteries-included `apollo-server` package) will still include both the `body-parser` and `cors` packages, but those options are not configurable.


## Removed constructor options

The follow `ApolloServer` constructor options have been removed in favor of other configuration methods.

### `dataSources`

Apollo Sever 4 removes the `dataSources` constructor option. The type returned from your context function matches the type available as context in your resolvers and plugins instead of the latter having an extra `dataSources` piece on it.

You can now add data sources to your context like so:

```ts
// Simple data source example
class DogsDataSource {
  private cache: KeyValueCache<string>;
  constructor({ cache }) {
    this.cache = cache;
  }

  async getDogs() {
    return [{ name: 'Fido' }];
  }
}

// We create a TS interface to ensure our GraphQL context
// is correctly typed and has everything we need it to
interface MyContext {
  dataSources: {
    dogs: DogsDataSource;
  }
}

// We create a new ApolloServer instance passing in our
// MyContext interface
const server = new ApolloServer<MyContext>({
  typeDefs: `
    type Query { dog: Dog }
    type Dog { name: String }
  `,
  resolvers: {
    Query: {
      dog: async (_, __, context) => {
        return (await context.dataSources.dogs.getDogs())[0];
      },
    },
  },
});

const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(server, {
  async context({ req, res }) {
    // Return an object to use for our GraphQL context
    return {
      // Within this object we create a new instance of our data source class.
      // Every GraphQL operation will have a new instance of the DogsDataSource
      // class.
      dataSources: {
        dogs: new DogsDataSource({ cache: server['internals'].cache })
      },
    };
  },
  listen: { port: 4000 },
});

console.log(`Server ready at ${url}`);
```

### `modules`
In Apollo Server 3 there are [several ways](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/6062) to provide your `ApolloServer` instance with a schema. One of these ways was by using a `modules` constructor option, which under the hood uses the `buildServiceDefinition` function from the `@apollographql/apollo-tooling` library, to specify a schema using an array of `typeDefs` and `resolvers` objects.

To simplify the Apollo Server 4 API, we removed the `modules` constructor option and recommend that developers use the following syntax to create a schema when creating a new `ApolloServer` instance:
```js
  new ApolloServer({
    typeDefs: modules.map({ typeDefs } => typeDefs,
    resolvers: modules.map({ resolvers } => resolvers,
  })
```

## Removed features

### Dropped support for older versions of the gateway

Apollo Server 4 drops support for [`@apollo/gateway` versions](/federation/api/apollo-gateway/) below v0.35.0.

#### Dropping Redundant Gateway TypeScript types

In Apollo Server 2, the TypeScript type used for the `gateway` constructor option is called `GraphQLService`. Apollo Server 3 introduced a new TypeScript type called `GatewayInterface`.

Apollo Server 4 will drop exporting the `SchemaChangeCallback` and `GraphQLService` types, we recommend using the `GatewayInterface` type instead.

This `GatewayInterface` requires the following:

- The `stop` method must be present.
- The `executor` method must async
- The `apollo` option must always be passed to the `load` method.

The `GraphQLExecutionResult` type (returned by `executor`) has been replaced by the similar `ExecutionResult` type from `graphql-js`. (The types are the same except that `data` and `extensions` are now `Record<string, unknown>` rather than `Record<string, any>`.)


### `__resolveObject`

Apollo Server 3 includes over nine core-maintained bindings for additional web frameworks and serverless environments.


### `formatResponse`

Removed `formatResponse` hook. The `willSendResponse` plugin API can accomplish similar goals. TODO show a replacement. TODO show example

### Remove features that wrap framework-specific libraries

<!-- TODO: expand and add links -->

Apollo Server 4 will replace a static set of hard-coded integrations
with a stable API which allows these integrations to be maintained by
people who actually run them in production.

One of the driving focuses behind Apollo Server 4 is creating a stable and well-defined API, enabling external developers who use to easily create and maintain integrations for new frameworks.

To that end, Apollo Server 4 removes the old integrations for now until the new integration packages are ready:
- "packages/apollo-server-fastify",
- "packages/apollo-server-hapi",
- "packages/apollo-server-koa",
- "packages/apollo-server-lambda",
- "packages/apollo-server-micro",
- "packages/apollo-server-cloud-functions",
- "packages/apollo-server-cloudflare",
- "packages/apollo-server-azure-functions",

> We are looking for volunteers to maintain these integrations! See the [issues with the 'integration-collaborators' label](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/labels/integration-collaborators) to join the discussion about your favorite web framework today.

### Remove body-parser & CORS wrapping
In Apollo Server 4, framework integration functions won't try to wrap these basic framework-specific libraries. If you want to use our Express middleware, you'll be required to use the standard body-parser middleware yourself.

<!-- EXAMPLE OF Body parser and cors using express middleware -->
```ts
```


Apollo Server 4's new `startStandaloneServer` function(the replacement for the batteries-included `apollo-server` package) will still include both the `body-parser` and `cors` packages, but you can not configure those options.

### Removed health checks

Load balancers often use health checks to determine if a server is available and ready to serve traffic. In Apollo Server 3 the health check feature supported a simple HTTP-level health check that was enabled by default and would always return the 200 status code. In Apollo Server 4 we removed the health checks feature.

We found that running a trivial GraphQL query was a much better way of checking the status of your server, because they ensure your server successfully serves traffic _and_ performs GraphQL operations.

Every GraphQL server supports a trivial query that requests the [`__typename`](../schema/schema/#the-__typename-field) of the top-level `Query` type.  This means every GraphQL server can respond to a `GET` request to a URL such as:

```bash
https://your.server/?query=%7B__typename%7D
```

If for some reason running this query is not an acceptable health check, folks integrating Apollo Server into a web framework can define their own health check via their web framework directly.

## Removed path parsing
Path parsing has been removed from Apollo Server 4. To further simplify the Apollo Server 4 API, if you'd like to mount your GraphQL server at a specified URL you can do so using your framework's specific middleware, like so:

<!-- TODO: Insert example here using path parsing with express-middleware -->
```ts
app.use('/api/graphql', apolloServer.getMiddleware())
```

If you want to run GraphQL on a non-root path, use your web framework’s functionality for mounting the middleware at the path. (Previously, the middlewares defaulted to only processing `/graphql`, and the g server processed all requests.)

### Removing support for older gateway versions

Apollo Server 4 drops support for [`@apollo/gateway` versions](/federation/api/apollo-gateway/) below v0.35.0.

### Removed fields from `GraphQLRequestContext` and `GraphQLServiceContext`
In Apollo Server 4 the `debug` and `schemaHash` fields are no longer available on `GraphQLRequestContext`.

The previous `schemaHash` field was an unstable hash of the introspection JSON of a schema. It was created for the operation registry plugin, but that plugin hasn't used it for a while and it was only kept around for backwards compatibility. Note that the `schemaHash` field is different from the hash of the schema SDL used by schema reporting.

We additionally removed the `persistedQueries` field from `GraphQLServiceContext`.

#### Dropping Redundant Gateway TypeScript types

In Apollo Server 2, the TypeScript type used for the `gateway` constructor option is called `GraphQLService`. Apollo Server 3 introduced a new TypeScript type called `GatewayInterface`.

Apollo Server 4 will drop exporting the `SchemaChangeCallback` and `GraphQLService` types, we recommend using the `GatewayInterface` type instead.

This `GatewayInterface` requires the following:

- The `stop` method must be present.
- The `executor` method must async
- The `apollo` option must always be passed to the `load` method.

### `__resolveObject`

In Apollo Server 4 we removed the dependency on `@apollographql/apollo-tooling`, in the process removing the `__resolveObject` pseudo-resolver. The `__resolveObject` function was a predecessor to
the [`__resolveReference`](/federation/api/apollo-subgraph/#__resolvereference) method.

## Changes to integration frameworks


### Express API is now a function `expressMiddleware` instead of getMiddleware/applyMiddleware methods on a subclass of ApolloServer

<!-- link to /apollo-server/packages/server/src/express/index.ts -->
Moreover, there is no subclassing of ApolloServer at all.

`expressMiddleware` has no runtime dependency on `express` (or any other package) although `standaloneServer` does.

### Express middleware no longer tries to also work with Express’ predecessor project “Connect”

If anybody needs [Connect middleware](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) they can add it themselves.



### The `apollo-server` npm package is now the `startStandaloneServer` function

<!--  TODO: working example with explanation for the why and how to use it -->
```ts
import { ApolloServer, startStandaloneServer } from "@apollo/server";

### `debug`

The `debug` constructor option is now `includeStackTracesInErrorResponses`:

```ts

const apolloServerInstance = new ApolloServer<MyContext>({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  includeStackTracesInErrorResponses: true,
});
```

const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(apolloServerInstance, {
  context: async ({req, _res}) => ({
    token: await getTokenForRequest(req),
  },
  listen: { port: 4000 },
});

## Changed Features


Note that you should only assume that the objects passed to your context function are http.IncomingMessage and http.ServerResponse objects, not necessarily their Express subclasses.

In Apollo Server 4, we introduce the `ApolloServerStandalone` class in the main Apollo Server package which is similar in concept, but removes ambiguity and makes the name more easily reference-able.

Below is the syntax for setting up the `ApolloServerStandalone` class:
```js
const apolloServerInstance = new ApolloServer<MyContext>({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

// startStandaloneServer returns an ApolloServerStandalone instance.
// listenOpts accepts the same arguments as http.Server's listen() method
const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(apolloServerInstance, listenOpts, serverOpts)
```

Below is a snippet of the full set up for creating an instance of `ApolloServerStandalone`:

```ts
import { ApolloServer, startStandaloneServer } from "@apollo/server";
import { typeDefs, resolvers } from "./schema";

interface MyContext {
  token: string;
}

const apolloServerInstance = new ApolloServer<MyContext>({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

//
const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(apolloServerInstance, {
  context: async ({req, _res}) => ({
    token: await getTokenForRequest(req),
  }),
  listen: { port: 4000 }
}).listen({ port: 4000 });

console.log(`🚀 Server listening at: ${url}`);

```

### Renamed context

In AS3 we use `context` for both "a function producing a context value"
and "the context value itself".

In Apollo Server 4 we change this for clarity. `context` continues to be used as the name of the "a function producing a context value":

```ts
interface MyContext {
  token: string;
}

const apolloServerInstance = new ApolloServer<MyContext>({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(apolloServerInstance, {
  context: async (req, _res) => ({
    token: await getTokenForRequest(req),
  }),
});

```

But any field containing a specific context value (such as on `GraphQLRequestContext`, the first argument to all plugin functions) is now named `contextValue`.

### New `@apollo/utils.fetcher` for TypeScript typing

In Apollo Server 3 the `apollo-server-env` package primarily provided TypeScript typings and polyfills for the `fetch` and `URL` APIs. With Apollo Server 4, we created a new `@apollo/utils.fetcher` which defines a more minimal
fetch API as `Fetcher` to provide TypeScript typings.

You can now use `@apollo/utils.fetcher` instead of `apollo-server-env` to provide Fetch API TypeScript typing.

We are removing the `requestAgent` option from `ApolloServerPluginUsageReporting`, because this option predated the fetcher option.

So, instead of:
```ts
  ApolloServerPluginUsageReporting({ requestAgent })
```

You can now write:

```ts
    import fetch from 'node-fetch';
    ApolloServerPluginUsageReporting({
      fetcher: (url, options) => fetch(url, {
        ...options,
        agent: requestAgent,
      }),
    });
```

### Local landing page defaults to embedded

The default landing page for local development now is an embedded Apollo Sandbox which allows you to run operations with no CORS setup required. To return to the AS3 default of a splash page linking to Apollo Sandbox, pass `ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault({embed: false})`.

### Error handling changes

#### Updates to ApolloError

TODO, see #6355.

#### Top-level error handling changes

Previously, some errors (mostly those that indicated the GraphQL operation was not being provided correctly over HTTP/JSON) were returned as `text/plain` error messages. Now all responses (other than landing pages) rendered by Apollo Server are `application/json` JSON responses; single-error responses are rendered as `{"errors":[{"message": "..."}]}` like any other GraphQL error. The `formatError` hook is used on all of these errors.

New plugin hooks `startupDidFail`, `contextCreationDidFail`, `invalidRequestWasReceived`, and `unexpectedErrorProcessingRequest` allow plugins to observe errors in new settings.

If `resolveOperation` or the `execute` function throws, the error will be rendered with HTTP status code 500 rather than 400. (Note that `execute` throwing is distinct from `execute` returning a non-empty list of errors, which is the more common case.)

### CSRF prevention (new in AS3.7) is on by default
By default, CSRF prevention is turned on in Apollo Server 4. For more information about CSRF prevention and CORS, see [Configuring CORS](/apollo-server/security/cors).

### ApolloServer’s generic argument is your context object type

Currently `ApolloServer` is genericized on the _arguments_ to the context function, rather the _actual_ context object itself. This means we don't get type inference into resolvers, inline plugins, etc.

Instead of passing context to the `ApolloServer` constructor at all, we choose to make it an _argument_ to the integration function. That way the arguments aren't genericized; they are specific to the function you're calling. Make the complete context object a parameter to the "execute this request' function.

We found a lot of places that `TContext` wasn't threaded through types and
added it.

Now you can do stuff like:

```ts
new ApolloServer<{ foo: number }>({
    Query: {
      n(_parent: any, _args: any, context): number {
        return context.foo;
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    {
      async requestDidStart({ context }) {
        let n: number = context.foo;
      },
    },
    // Plugins declared to be <BaseContext> still work.
    ApolloServerPluginCacheControlDisabled(),
  ],
});
```

This also simplifies `executeOperation`, where you just pass a context
object directly instead of arguments to your context function.

### Context function is passed to your middleware-specific integration function (eg `expressMiddleware` or `startStandaloneServer`) instead of ApolloServer constructor

`ApolloServerBase` is now just `ApolloServer`. Context function is now a
named argument to the middleware; it's required if your context type is
not the default BaseContext.

Note that we differentiate in names between
"contextFunction" (a function returning a context object) and "context"
(the context object itself, eg as an argument to executeOperation).


#### `server.executeOperation` now takes a context *value* rather than arguments to pass to your context function.

This also simplifies executeOperation, where you just pass a context
object directly instead of arguments to your (probably already
fake-for-testing) context function.

We found that in practice, that’s what people actually wanted in tests. If you want to test the behavior of your context function, you can unit-test it directly.


### Change CacheScope enum to a pure type

<!-- In Apollo Server 4 the `CacheControlScope` enum has been changed into a union of strings type (`PUBLIC` or `PRIVATE`). This mean you can’t write `CacheScope.public` anymore
- The enum CacheScope is now union of strings type
  - (scope: CacheScope.Private -> scope: 'PRIVATE') -->

In Apollo Server 3, you can use the [`@cacheControl`](/apollo-server/performance/caching/#in-your-schema-static) to define caching behavior on a per-field basis. Under the hood, the `@cacheControl` directive uses a `CacheControlScope` enum.

Users will write 'PUBLIC' directly instead of `CacheScope.Public`. Note that if they are using TypeScript this is still perfectly type-safe (a typo will fail to compile); and if they're not using TypeScript, well misspelling `public` doesn't crash Node either, so perhaps they should use TypeScript if they care about such things.

```ts
enum CacheControlScope {
  PUBLIC
  PRIVATE
}
```

### Combine many packages into a single @apollo/server
We combined the following packages into a single `@apollo/server` package:
- apollo-server-core
- apollo-server (the "batteries-included" package)
- apollo-server-express
- apollo-server-errors

### Express API is now a function `expressMiddleware` instead of getMiddleware/applyMiddleware methods on a subclass of ApolloServer

<!-- link to /apollo-server/packages/server/src/express/index.ts -->
Moreover, there is no subclassing of ApolloServer at all.

`expressMiddleware` has no runtime dependency on `express` (or any other package) although `startStandaloneServer` does.

## Express middleware no longer tries to also work with Express’ predecessor project “Connect”

If anybody needs [Connect middleware](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) they can add it themselves.

<!-- This ended up being its own package -->
- apollo-reporting-protobuf

### `apollo-server-plugin-operation-registry`
The plugin `apollo-server-plugin-operation-registry` has been renamed to `@apollo/server-plugin-operation-registry`.

## HTTP handling changes

### `variables` and `extensions` should not be doubly-encoded

In JSON-encoded POST bodies, we expect variables and extensions (if provided) to be objects, not strings containing JSON strings of objects:

This works:
```
{“query”: “{ __typename }”, extensions: {“foo”: 1}}
```

And this does not:
```
{“query”: “{ __typename }”, extensions: “{\“foo\”: 1}”}
```

### HTTP batching as opt-in feature

Apollo Server supports [HTTP batching](link TODO), which allows multiple GraphQL operations to be executed as part of a single HTTP request (sharing a single context function invocation as well). Note that HTTP batching is not supported by all GraphQL clients and does not currently support incremental delivery. HTTP batching can save performance by sharing a context object across operations, but can also make reasoning about the amount of work any given request can do harder.

In Apollo Server 3, support for HTTP batching was on by default and could be disabled by passing `allowBatchedHttpRequests: false` to `new ApolloServer()`. In Apollo Server 4, you must explicitly enable this feature by passing `allowBatchedHttpRequests: true` to `new ApolloServer()`.

<!-- TODO: investigate more! -->

### Plugin API changes

Remove schemaHash field from GraphQLRequestContext
This was a not particularly stable hash of the introspection JSON of a
schema. It was different from the hash of the schema SDL used by schema
reporting. It was created for the operation registry plugin but that
plugin hasn't used it for a while and it was only kept around for
backwards compatibility. So now it is gone.


Remove debug field from GraphQLRequestContext.

Remove persistedQueries field from GraphQLServerContext

`GraphQLResponse` object (eg `requestContext.response`) has been refactored: the `data`, `errors`, and `extensions` fields are on a `result` sub-object. (This will change further for incremental delivery.) `data` and `extensions` are now `Record<string, unknown>` rather than `Record<string, any>` so more casts may be needed. `GraphQLRequestContext.response` and `GraphQLResponse.http` are now always set.

requestDidStart hooks are called in parallel rather than in series.

## New APIs

### `addPlugin` function

Apollo Server 4 introduces a new public function on the `ApolloServer` class, `addPlugin`. The `addPlugin` function enables you to add plugins to `ApolloServer` _before_ you start a server (i.e., before calling `server.start()`).

```ts
import express from 'express';
import http from 'http';
import cors from 'cors';
import { json } from 'body-parser';
import { ApolloServer, ApolloServerPluginDrainHttpServer } from '@apollo/server';
// TODO: Double check this import
import { expressMiddleware } from '@apollo/server/express';
import { typeDefs, resolvers } from ('./schema');

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

// Add our ApolloServerPluginDrainHttpServer plug in *before* starting the server
server.addPlugin(ApolloServerPluginDrainHttpServer({ httpServer }));

await server.start();
// Set up express middleware with body-parsing and cors
app.use(cors(), json(), expressMiddleware(server));
await new Promise<void>((resolve) => httpServer.listen({ port: 4000 }, resolve));

console.log(`🚀 Server ready at http://localhost:4000`);
```

The new `addPlugin` function is useful if you'd like to pass the server itself to a plugin’s constructor.

### New HTTP request execution API
<!-- TODO: Figure out the final form of this -->
There’s a lot here :)
Also we’ve changed the TypeScript names of the constructor options object from Config to ApolloServerOptions.

## Server lifecycle

### New approach to serverless frameworks

Instead of subclassing `ApolloServer` and overriding `serverlessFramework()` to return true, serverless integrations differentiate themselves from other integrations by calling `server.startInBackgroundHandlingStartupErrorsByLoggingAndFailingAllRequests()`; other integrations expect the caller to first call `await server.start()` and validate this with `server.assertStarted()`.


### New warning when starting to execute an operation during shutdown

Apollo Server v3.2.0 added a "draining" phase to server shutdown which allows a server to complete in-progress operations before continuing to shut down. (This is set up automatically for you when using `startStandaloneServer` and can be configured with `ApolloServerPluginDrainHttpServer` when using `expressMiddleware` or other `http.Server`-based web servers.) If you do not drain your server, incoming operations can be sent to your server after it has already been stopped, which will fail. In Apollo Server 4, if a server receives an operation after the "draining" phase continues, it will log a warning encouraging you to set up draining before failing the operation.

### New API to support serverless frameworks
The main difference for Apollo Server between serverless and other
frameworks is that serverless frameworks typically need to provide a
request handler *synchronously* on startup. So our model of "you must
call `await server.start()` before your web server listens" doesn't
work.

The other minor differences are that the default value of
`stopOnTerminationSignals` is false for serverless integrations and the
default value of the usage reporting plugin's `sendReportsImmediately` is
`true` for serverless integrations; the latter was implemented via the
`serverlessFramework` option to the plugin `serverWillStart` API. In both
cases, this merely affected the default values and could be overridden
explicitly to true or false by the user.

The Apollo Sever 3 implementation was based on *subclassing* and overriding a
`serverlessFramework()` method; if this is true, the ApolloServer
constructor would start the startup process "in the background", logging
errors.

In AS4 we don't subclass `ApolloServer` at all.  Our new implementation
works by providing a synchronous alternative to `start()` called
`startInBackgroundHandlingStartupErrorsByLoggingAndFailingAllRequests()`.
The length of the name is intended to discourage its use directly by app
writers when they are building non-serverless apps and `await
server.start()` is an option.

Calling this function works similarly to the implicit call at the end of
the AS3 serverless constructor. Additionally, it allows
`server.assertStarted()` to succeed even if startup is still ongoing.

The intended usage goes like this:

```ts
 await startStandaloneServer(server);
```

For a non-serverless middleware, the user should await `start()`. Note
that `expressMiddleware` itself calls `assertStarted`.

```ts
await server.start();
app.use(expressMiddleware(server));
app.listen();
```


For a serverless middleware (not implemented in core), the user doesn't
have to call any start-related function:
```ts
exports.handler = lambdaHandler(server);
```
The `lambdaHandler` function should call
`startInBackgroundHandlingStartupErrorsByLoggingAndFailingAllRequests`
for you.

In some cases, a serverless middleware might be implemented in terms of
a non-serverless middleware. For example, one approach to implementing
`lambdaHandler` would be to combine `expressMiddleware` with `express`
and `@vendia/serverless-express`. This is why we have the special case
that `assertStarted` (called by `expressMiddleware`) doesn't throw if
startup is currently taking place in the background.

We continue to have the default values of `stopOnTerminationSignals` and
`sendReportsImmediately` be influenced by whether you called start or
`startInBackgroundHandlingStartupErrorsByLoggingAndFailingAllRequests`. We
do change the `serverWillStart` option from `serverlessFramework` to
`startedInBackground`.

While we're at it, we added a new logged warning if any operations start
executing during the stopping or stopped phase encouraging users to use
a drain plugin.

Note: we add an invocation of the integration tests that combines Express
with this new API. That's not because we think people using Express should
use the API; it just means we were able to ensure that the tests could potentially work with the new API.  This helped us discover that (in the start-in-background case) `executeHTTPGraphQLRequest` throws rather than returns an error response if startup failed, which we should fix in a subsequent PR.


# Upcoming Stuff to Cover:
- Replace implementations of the cache interface with `keyv`
We no longer maintain `apollo-server-cache-memcached` or `apollo-server-cache-redis`. The interfaces and classes for `apollo-server-caching` are now in `@apollo/utils.keyvaluecache`
We now maintain (`@apollo/utils.keyv`) which wraps Keyv and lets you use their implementation of memcached and redis bindings (among others).
Existing implementations of `KeyValueCache` should continue to work.
- Mention that specifically redis users currently get a 300s default TTL, which will change when they move to Keyv. Our other cache implementations don't do this. This may or may not be worth mentioning since they should be reading the documentation for @keyv/redis when they make the switch and should configure it to their needs. But it wouldn't hurt to at least point it out.
- Mention that default cache is now bounded, `cache: 'bounded'` can be deleted

- Explicit support in core for serverless-style startup error handling
- Move other plugins to their own repositories
- Change usage reporting defaults backwards-incompatibly to send less data
- Rethink ApolloError
- ApolloServer.logger should probably be public readonly in AS4
- Ensure errors thrown in context creation is handled in a helpful way
- Apollo Server plugins: expose server instance to plugins
- In general we just need to go over the full exported API and list what’s gone and where it’s gone. (This includes the re-export of `gql` from `graphql-tag`)
